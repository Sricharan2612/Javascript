Javascript was invented by Brendan eich in 1995.

it was initially known as mocha, later it was changed to livescript since we can see the changes live in the realtime.

since java name was popular at that time, the name was again changed to javascript which gained a lot of popularity.

it was originally created for netscape, later adopted by ECMA due to the maintenance issues.

After being adopted by ECMA it was made opensource, which helped others to use it for their browsers also.
