Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.

syntax:
const function_name = (param) =>{
    //operations
}

eg.1
let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;

eg.2
const hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

eg.3
const sum = (x1,x2) =>{
return x+x2
}
sum(5,5)

if arrow function has single param then :
cost arrow_funtion = x => x+2
